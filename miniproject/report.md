## Data Source
I downloaded a dataset called **"Salary Prediction"** from the Kaggle website. The dataset consists of various columns, including **job title, job description, company name, location, size,** etc.

## Research Problem
What factors help predict the **average salary** most effectively?

## Target Variable
**Average Salary**

## Data Cleaning Process
I did not clean the data much, but I did try to remove some rows that were **duplicates**.

## Training Process
I used **Quick Build** on **SageMaker Canvas** and applied the **default settings** to train the model.

## Model Performance
**RÂ² = 99.905%**
